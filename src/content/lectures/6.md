In this lecture, we will learn:

Why...

- Do we need real-time features in web applications?
- Are Websockets a better choice than classic methods like long-polling?
- Are webhooks important for implementing real-time features from third-party services?
- Do we need to use different strategies when scaling up the number of users with WebRTC?

How to...

- Use Websockets for two-way communication between client and server
- Use Server Sent Events (SSE) for one-way communication from server to client
- Receive and process webhooks from third-party services using best practices
