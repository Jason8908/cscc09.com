The project allows you to demonstrate that you have mastered full-stack development concepts learned from this course. As a team of 2-3, you will create a publicly available web application.

## Alpha Version (5%) - Github

You must schedule a 15-minute meeting with a TA before the deadline. To receive full credit, you must demonstrate reasonable progress toward your alpha version milestone.

At this point, all your code should be pushed to the `main` branch on Github.

## Academic Integrity

The course policy on academic integrity applies to this project. This means that all code developed for this project must be written exclusively by the members of the team. Any use of UI elements and snippets of code found on the web must be clearly cited in a credit page of the application. If you are using Github Copilot for code generation, you must also write the prompt you used the generate the code as an in-line comment.

You have the freedom to build whatever you want as a project, however the following restrictions strictly apply:

- You must not use your code that was developed from outside this course.
- You must not use your code that was developed for a paid or unpaid job.
- You must not use your code that was developed for another course, such as CSCC01.
- During the duration of the project, you must not be concurrently paid to do the same project for another entity.

Each team member will be held accountable for the work they submit to the teamâ€™s GitHub repository.
