The project allows you to demonstrate that you have mastered full-stack development concepts learned from this course. As a team of 2-3, you will create a publicly available web application.

## Beta Version (10%) - Github

You must schedule a 15-minute meeting with an assigned industry expert before the deadline. During the
meeting, you will demonstrate a majority of the features completed.

You will be graded from 1-10 on how good this project is if it was considered in a hiring decision. (1 - will not hire, 10 - definitely hire)

Note that you will be graded in comparison to other teams assigned to the same industry expert.

At this point, all your code should be pushed to `main` branch on Github, and ideally deployed to a public URL already.

## Academic Integrity

The course policy on academic integrity applies to this project. This means that all code developed for this project must be written exclusively by the members of the team. Any use of UI elements and snippets of code found on the web must be clearly cited in a credit page of the application.

You have the freedom to build whatever you want as a project, however the following restrictions strictly apply:

- You must not use your code that was developed from outside this course.
- You must not use your code that was developed for a paid or unpaid job.
- You must not use your code that was developed for another course, such as CSCC01.
- During the duration of the project, you must not be concurrently paid to do the same project for another entity.

Each team member will be held accountable for the work they submit to the teamâ€™s GitHub repository.
