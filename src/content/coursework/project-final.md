The project allows you to demonstrate that you have mastered full-stack development concepts learned from this course. As a team of 2-3, you will create a publicly available web application.

## Final Version (75%) - Github and Gradescope

You must push everything to main branch on Github, and also submit the code through Gradescope.

You must add the application's deployed URL to README.md.

Your application must remain available throughout the marking period, which is 2 weeks after the final version deadline.

As mentioned in “Required Elements”, if the application is not deployed or not accessible, you will not receive credit for the final version.

## Video Demo (5%) - Github and Gradescope

Record a 3-minute-long video demonstrating the core features of your web application. You should record the video as if it was part of a hiring process.

Do not show slides, do not show code. Do not spend too long on unimportant features such as login/signup.

Upload your video to Youtube and include it in README.md. The presentation is going to determine who gets to present at the final lecture.

## Final Lecture Presentation (1%-10% bonus)

The top projects of this course will be selected to present in the final lecture to showcase to the entire class. Industry experts will be invited as judges to select the top 3 projects, which will get a bonus attached to their project.

## Academic Integrity

The course policy on academic integrity applies to this project. This means that all code developed for this project must be written exclusively by the members of the team. Any use of UI elements and snippets of code found on the web must be clearly cited in a credit page of the application.

You have the freedom to build whatever you want as a project, however the following restrictions strictly apply:

- You must not use your code that was developed from outside this course.
- You must not use your code that was developed for a paid or unpaid job.
- You must not use your code that was developed for another course, such as CSCC01.
- During the duration of the project, you must not be concurrently paid to do the same project for another entity.

Each team member will be held accountable for the work they submit to the team’s GitHub repository.
