The project allows you to demonstrate that you have mastered full-stack development concepts learned from this course. As a team of 2-3, you will create a publicly available web application.

## Final Version (75%) - Github and Gradescope

You must push everything to main branch on Github, and also submit the code through Gradescope.

You must add the application's deployed URL to README.md.

Your application must remain available throughout the marking period, which is 2 weeks after the final version deadline.

As mentioned in “Required Elements”, if the application is not deployed or not accessible, you will not receive any credit for the final version.

## Video Demo (5%) - Github and Gradescope

Record a 3-minute-long video demonstrating the core features of your web application. You should record the video as if it was part of a hiring process.

Do not show slides, do not show code. Do not show the sign up / login process unless it contains a unique feature that is not already covered in "Security and Payment Requirement".

Upload your video to Youtube and include it in README.md. The presentation is going to determine who gets to present at the final lecture.

Furthermore, please also fill in this Google Form (link will be provided later) to be eligible to be selected for the Presentation bonus.

## Final Lecture Presentation (1%-10% bonus)

Outstanding web applications will be chosen to present in the last lecture. Selected projects (usually around 30%, maybe more) will obtain a bonus from 1% to 10%. Invited industry experts will make the final decision.

## Academic Integrity

The course policy on academic integrity applies to this project. This means that all code developed for this project must be written exclusively by the members of the team. Any use of UI elements and snippets of code found on the web must be clearly cited in a credit page of the application. If you are using Github Copilot for code generation, you must also write the prompt you used the generate the code as an in-line comment.

You have the freedom to build whatever you want as a project, however the following restrictions strictly apply:

- You must not use your code that was developed from outside this course.
- You must not use your code that was developed for a paid or unpaid job.
- You must not use your code that was developed for another course, such as CSCC01.
- During the duration of the project, you must not be concurrently paid to do the same project for another entity.

Each team member will be held accountable for the work they submit to the team’s GitHub repository.
